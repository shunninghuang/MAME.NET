# MAME.NET
C# arcade emulator
## Introduction
MAME (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator) is a free and open source emulator designed to recreate the hardware of arcade game system in software on modern personal computers and other platforms. MAME.NET is a C# based arcade emulator, and it maintains the same architecture of MAME. By using C# and the powerful integrated development environment -- Microsoft Visual Studio, there is no macro and you can debug the supported arcade game anywhere. There are some classic boards supported by now: M72, M92, Taito B, Capcom, CPS-1, CPS-1(Qsound), CPS2, Data East, Tehkan, Konami 68000, Neo Geo, Technos, Namco System 1, IGS011, PGM(PolyGame Master).
MAME.NET runs at the following steps: load the ROMs, initialize the machine, soft reset the machine, and loop "cpuexec_timeslice" operation. The "cpuexec_timeslice" operation means sequentially execute every CPU for a time slice, and execute timer callbacks. Timer callbacks contains: video update, soft reset, CPU interrupt, sound update, watchdog reset and other interrupts. By these steps, MAME.NET emulates the arcade board successfully. MAME.NET has more functions: save and load state, record and replay input, cheat, cheat search, IPS (patch main ROM), board debugger, CPU debugger.
